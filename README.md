__*ALL THANKS TO OLLAMA API*__

This is intended to be a highschool kid python project that aims at a chatbot with face unlock, speech recognition with google's engine, text-to-speech responses and much more. The aim was to simply kill time, and I'm pretty much confident that I peaked at it, I mean...at killing time. *Only the python script available at the moment.*

__System Requirements__ :
              
1. Atleast 16 GB RAM.
2. Preferrably a GPU that is listed on -- https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md#gpu.
3. A modern CPU (at least quad-core) with high-performance capabilities.

__STEPS__ :

1. Download and install Ollama for your OS from : https://ollama.com/download
2. Download and install python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Necessary python libraries are speech_recognition, pyttsx3, requests, json, cv2, face_recognition, time, subprocess and os.
